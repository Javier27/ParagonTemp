/**
 `PGBaseAPIClient` is a subclass of `NSObject` and utilizes `PGNetworkingManager`, `PGObjectMapping`,  and `PGEndpointRequest` to create a convenient way to hit web API endpoints in an organized and succinct manner. For this class to work properly, it requires that the developer working with it has stored endpoints in the `PGNetworkingManager`

 ## Subclassing Notes
 This class is intended to be subclassed. As a standard, there should be one PGBaseAPIClient per view controller to make the view controller's requests easily cancellable upone completion. If you wish to have requests made that are not directly coupled to a view controller, then you should create a singleton object for performing such requests. This can be done in the following manner within a subclass:
 + (instancetype)sharedAPIClient
 {
   static ExampleSubclassedAPIClient *instance;
   static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
   dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{
     instance = [[ExampleSubclassedAPIClient alloc] init];
   });

   return instance;
 }
 
 then use this instance by calling [ExampleSubclassedAPIClient sharedAPIClient]

 ## Methods to Override
 If you want to override the header structure used so that it is dynamic, please override `headersForRequest:`, the existing behavior simply gets your standard headers from `PGNetworkingManager` if you wish this behavior to continue, then after handling any of your curtom header cases, as a final case simply call [super headersForRequest:]
